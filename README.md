# CasaOs Resources
My personal list of Docker Compose files, for building cutom containers on CasaOs.

## Volume Mapping
These all use MY personal VOLUME mapping, and should you wish to use these compose files, I suggest that you change the mapping.

e.g. I use my personally mounted drive `/mnt/Storage1_nvme0n1p1`, so remove this sub-string if you want to use the default.
